# CHANGELOG

## [2024-01-24] - Family Sync Management System

### Added
- **Direct family sync relationships**: Added `daycare_sync_id` and `school_sync_id` fields to families table
- **Automatic sync assignment**: When calendar syncs are created, they're automatically assigned to the owning family
- **Sync management service**: Created comprehensive service for managing sync relationships between families and providers
- **Enhanced database view**: Updated `family_all_events` view to use direct family sync relationships for better performance

### Changed  
- **Improved sync logic**: Events now display based on direct family sync assignments rather than complex joins
- **Provider endpoints**: Updated school and daycare provider endpoints to automatically manage family sync assignments
- **Database efficiency**: Simplified the relationship between families and their calendar syncs

### Technical Details
- Added foreign key relationships: `families.daycare_sync_id` → `daycare_calendar_syncs.id`
- Added foreign key relationships: `families.school_sync_id` → `school_calendar_syncs.id`
- Created indexes for optimal query performance
- Migrated existing data: Levensailor family now has both daycare and school syncs

### Verification
✅ Family calendar displays daycare events from "The Learning Tree" when daycare sync is active  
✅ Family calendar displays school events from "Gregory Elementary" when school sync is active  
✅ Events properly filtered based on family sync agreements  
✅ Production deployment successful with HTTP 200 health check

## [2024-01-21] - Major Refactoring: School and Daycare Events Architecture

### Changed
- **Separated school and daycare events into dedicated tables**: Events are now stored in `school_events` and `daycare_events` tables indexed by provider ID instead of family ID
- **Improved efficiency**: Events are stored once per provider, eliminating duplicate storage across families
- **Added database view**: Created `family_all_events` view that combines family, school, and daycare events based on sync agreements
- **Updated API endpoints**: Modified events endpoints to use the new view for seamless event retrieval
- **Enhanced sync service**: Created unified `event_sync_service.py` to manage all calendar syncing operations

### Added
- New database tables: `school_events` and `daycare_events` with proper indexes
- New schemas: `SchoolEvent` and `DaycareEvent` with bulk operations support
- New sync script: `sync_all_calendars.py` for periodic updates
- New cron setup: `setup_calendar_sync_cron.sh` for automated daily syncing

### Migration
- Created `migrate_school_daycare_events_tables.py` to:
  - Create new tables with proper structure
  - Migrate existing events from the old format
  - Create the unified events view
  - Clean up old event data

### Benefits
- **Performance**: Significantly reduced database storage and query time
- **Scalability**: Events are stored once per provider, not duplicated per family
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between different event types
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new event sources in the future
