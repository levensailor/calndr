## [2025-07-24] - Fixed Duplicate Daycare Events in iOS App

### Fixed
- **Duplicate daycare events**: Resolved July 4th showing twice under Daycare section in iOS app
- **Event fetching optimization**: Reduced API calls from 3 to 1 for better performance
- **Data consistency**: Ensured single source of truth for all event types

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Database verification**: Only 1 daycare event existed for July 4th ("Fourth of July")
- **iOS duplication**: App was fetching daycare events twice:
  - Via `/events/` API (returns ALL events via `family_all_events` view)
  - Via `/events/daycare/` API (returns daycare-only events)
- **Combination issue**: `familyEvents + schoolEvents + daycareEvents` caused duplicates

### iOS CalendarViewModel Improvements
- **Simplified API logic**: Removed separate `fetchSchoolEvents()` and `fetchDaycareEvents()` calls
- **Single endpoint**: Main `/events/` API already returns ALL event types (family, school, daycare)
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained legacy `schoolEvents` array for existing UI components
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed event breakdown by `source_type` for debugging

### Technical Benefits
- **Performance improvement**: 66% reduction in API calls (3→1) for event fetching
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth eliminates synchronization issues
- **Reliability**: Reduces potential for race conditions and data inconsistencies
- **Maintainability**: Simplified code logic with better error handling

### Database Connection Pool Configuration
- **databases.Database**: Added `min_size=1`, `max_size=5` per worker with `force_rollback=True` and `ssl="prefer"`
- **SQLAlchemy engine**: Configured `pool_size=5`, `max_overflow=10`, `pool_timeout=30s`, `pool_recycle=3600s`, `pool_pre_ping=True`
- **Connection limits**: Maximum 10 total connections (2 workers × 5 connections each)

### Worker Optimization
- **Reduced workers**: Changed from 4 to 2 gunicorn workers to minimize connection usage
- **Improved efficiency**: Better resource utilization while maintaining performance
- **Connection management**: Each worker limited to 5 database connections maximum

### Monitoring & Debugging
- **Enhanced health endpoint**: `/health` now tests database connectivity and reports connection status
- **Database info endpoint**: Added `/db-info` for connection pool monitoring and debugging
- **Proactive monitoring**: Database status included in health checks for better observability

### Technical Benefits
- **Prevents connection exhaustion**: Proper pooling prevents hitting RDS connection limits
- **Automatic recovery**: Connection recycling and pre-ping ensure healthy connections
