# CHANGELOG

## [2025-01-28 00:23 EST] - Custody Records JSON Format Mismatch Investigation

### 🚨 **Secondary Issue Identified: JSON Decoding Failure**
- **Error**: "Expected to decode Array<Any> but found a dictionary instead"
- **Affected**: Custody records fetching for months 2025-6, 2025-7, 2025-8
- **Root Cause**: iOS app expects array `[CustodyResponse]` but backend returns dictionary
- **Status**: Debugging enhanced with comprehensive logging

### 🔍 **JSON Response Debugging Added**
- **📄 Raw JSON Logging**: Enable complete API response logging for custody endpoints
- **🔄 Multi-Strategy Decoding**: Fallback decoding attempts for different response formats:
  1. Try as expected array `[CustodyResponse]`
  2. Fallback to single `CustodyResponse` wrapped in array
  3. Fallback to dictionary wrapper with `data`/`custody_records`/`records` field
- **📊 Enhanced Error Context**: Show URL, status code, and full response content

### 🎯 **Backend Analysis**
- **Expected Endpoint**: `GET /custody/{year}/{month}` → `List[CustodyResponse]` (array)
- **API Definition**: `@router.get("/{year}/{month}", response_model=List[CustodyResponse])`
- **Hypothesis**: Error responses or middleware may be wrapping array in dictionary

### 📝 **Investigation Strategy**
1. **📄📄📄** - Look for raw JSON response logs
2. **📄 Status Code** - Check HTTP response status (200 vs error codes)
3. **📄 Response** - Examine actual JSON structure returned
4. **✅/❌** - Track decode success/failure patterns

### 🔗 **Related Issues**
This JSON format issue is separate from but may be related to the JWT token corruption issue. Both affect custody functionality but have different root causes.
