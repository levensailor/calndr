# CHANGELOG

## [2025-08-19 10:15 EST] - iOS: Fix AddMedicationView type-checking timeout

- Refactored `ios/calndr/calndr/AddMedicationView.swift` to split the large `body` into smaller subviews and added computed color properties to simplify expressions.
- Replaced `ForEach(0..<presets.count)` with `ForEach(presets.indices)` for safer indexing.
- Result: Resolved "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time" error and improved readability/maintainability.

### [2025-08-19 10:20 EST] - iOS: Replace deprecated onChange(of:) usage

- Updated `AddMedicationView` to use the iOS 17 `onChange` zero-parameter closure form instead of the deprecated single-parameter variant for `selectedPresetIndex`.

### [2025-08-19 10:28 EST] - iOS: Fix Pharmacy "Add Provider" tap not responding

- Updated `EnhancedMedicalSearchView` result rows to avoid nested `Button` in `List` rows which could swallow taps.
- Made the "Add Provider" control an explicit `Button` and attached `.onTapGesture` to the row for consistent selection behavior.

### [2025-08-19 10:39 EST] - iOS: Correct pharmacy categorization and deletion behavior

- Partitioned providers into `medicalProviders` vs `pharmacies` in `CalendarViewModel.fetchMedicalProviders()` based on `specialty == "Pharmacy"`.
- Updated `saveMedicalProvider`/`updateMedicalProvider` to insert/update in the correct array and move items when specialty changes.
- Updated `deleteMedicalProvider` to remove from both arrays so deletions reflect in Pharmacies as well.
- Removed redundant manual pharmacy append in `AddPharmacyView` to prevent duplicates.

## [2025-08-10 15:02 EST] - Medication presets and reminders UX

- Backend: Added `/api/v1/medications/presets` endpoint returning curated pediatric medication presets (Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec, Benadryl, Amoxicillin) with common dosages and frequencies; includes schema `MedicationPreset` and `MedicationPresetListResponse`.
- iOS: Updated `AddMedicationView` to support selecting a preset (with dosage and frequency pickers populated from the preset) while still allowing custom entries. Added fetch via `APIService.fetchMedicationPresets()` and an automatic application of defaults. Reminder toggle remains and is validated by backend.
- Note: Custom medications are still supported by choosing "Custom".

## [2025-08-10 14:41 EST] - Auto-sync backend changes to calndrclub

- Added `scripts/sync-backend-to-calndrclub.sh` to mirror `backend/backend/` into `calndrclub/backend/` with rsync and push.
- Added `scripts/install-backend-sync-hook.sh` which installs local git hooks (`post-commit`, `post-merge`, `post-checkout`) to run the sync automatically whenever changes affect `backend/backend/`.
- Usage: run `./scripts/install-backend-sync-hook.sh` once per local clone; hooks then keep the backend repo up to date automatically.

## [2025-08-10 14:35 EST] - Fix stale handoff flags after custody edits

- **Problem**: Changing a day's custodian sometimes left the prior handoff flag on the edited day, even when the handoff should shift to the following day (e.g., Monday P1, Tuesday P2 → handoff Tuesday; change Tuesday to P1 → handoff should move to Wednesday, but Tuesday remained marked as a handoff).
- **Backend fix**: The custody update endpoint now recalculates adjacency-based handoff flags on every update:
  - Derives the edited day's `handoff_day` from the previous day when the client doesn't explicitly set it, and sets sensible default time/location when enabling.
  - Recomputes the next day's `handoff_day` based on the new ownership boundary; clears time/location if no longer a handoff, or sets defaults if enabling and none provided.
  - Invalidates custody and handoff caches for affected months (current and potentially next month) to ensure the UI refreshes correctly.
- **Impact**: Handoff markers no longer remain on the wrong day after custody changes; the marker shifts correctly to the next boundary.

## [2025-01-26 21:18 EST] - Fix Schedule Editing Days Not Populating

**✅ RESOLVED: Custom schedule editing interface not showing day assignments**

Fixed issue where clicking "custom schedule" to edit would display empty day assignments instead of the existing schedule data:

**Problem Identified:**
- ScheduleEditView was initializing with empty WeeklySchedulePattern() instead of using template data
- Days weren't being populated when editing existing custom schedules
- Users saw blank day assignments even though schedule data existed in database

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- ScheduleEditView was using empty default initialization instead of template data
- No fallback mechanism if API call to fetch detailed template failed
- Missing proper State initialization with template data in init()

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive initialization in ScheduleEditView to use template data immediately
- Created custom init() that populates all State variables with template data
- Added detailed debug logging to track template loading process
- Added fallback logic to use initial template data if API fetch fails
- Ensures days are populated even if there are API communication issues

**Impact:**
- Custom schedule editing now properly displays existing day assignments
- Users can see and modify their current schedule setup immediately
- Improved reliability with fallback data handling
- Better debugging capabilities for future troubleshooting

## [2025-08-04 21:25 EST] - CRITICAL FIX: Database Schema Issue - Medical Tables Creation

Fixed critical database schema error that was preventing medical provider and medication functionality:

**Problem Identified:**
- Medical provider creation failing with database error: `column "google_place_id" of relation "medical_providers" does not exist`
- Backend logs showed 2025-08-04 13:18:33 EST [ERROR] during medical provider creation attempts
- medical_providers and medications tables were completely missing from production database
- Enhanced search functionality was implemented but couldn't be used due to missing database schema

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Previous migration scripts were not compatible with production environment configuration
- Database tables were never successfully created in production despite successful deployments
- Missing import dependencies in migration scripts (config.get_settings not available)
- Schema mismatch between code models and actual database structure

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `create_medical_tables_simple.py` migration script with direct environment variable usage
- Successfully deployed and executed migration on production server (cal-db-instance.cjy8vmu6rtrc.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com)
- Created complete medical_providers table (17 columns) with all required fields including google_place_id, rating
- Created complete medications table (13 columns) with full medication management capabilities
- Added performance indexes on critical fields (family_id, name, specialty, is_active)
- Verified foreign key constraints to families and users tables

**Database Schema Created:**
```sql
medical_providers: id, family_id, name, specialty, address, phone, email, website, 
                  latitude, longitude, zip_code, notes, google_place_id, rating, 
                  created_by_user_id, created_at, updated_at

medications: id, family_id, name, dosage, frequency, instructions, start_date, 
            end_date, is_active, reminder_enabled, reminder_time, notes, 
            created_at, updated_at
```

**Verification and Testing:**
- ✅ Backend health check confirms database connectivity maintained
- ✅ Tables successfully created on production server
- ✅ All columns including google_place_id and rating now available
- ✅ Medical provider and medication CRUD operations now functional
- ✅ Enhanced search with map integration now fully supported

**Impact:**

- Two-finger pinch gestures on map to dynamically adjust search radius
- ZIP code search with location-based radius visualization
- Optional search terms for specialized filtering (e.g., "pediatrician", "urgent care", "cardiologist")
- "Try expanding your search" notice when fewer than 3 providers are found with quick expand button
- Enhanced provider result cards with better information display and one-tap addition

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Prominent "Search with Map" option in AddDoctorView with visual map icon
- Preserved "Quick Search Near Me" for users who prefer simple location-based search
- Automatic search refresh when radius is significantly changed
- Clear visual feedback with radius circle overlay on map
- Helpful error messages and expansion suggestions for better results
- RadiusEditorView modal for precise distance control with preset values

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `EnhancedMedicalSearchView` with MapKit integration and MKCoordinateRegion management
- Added `RadiusEditorView` with unit conversion (miles/kilometers) and preset quick-select options
- Updated `MedicalSearchRequest` model to include `specialty` and `query` parameters
- Enhanced backend search logic to prioritize user-provided query terms over default medical keywords
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing search functionality
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for all search parameters

**Backend API Enhancements:**

- Maintained Google Places API integration with enhanced parameter handling

All changes are fully tested, deployed, and backward compatible with existing iOS app functionality.

## [2025-08-03 12:42 EST] - Fix iOS Medical Provider 401 Authentication Error

Fixed critical 401 authentication error when saving medical providers from the iOS app:

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- iOS app was making POST requests to `/api/v1/medical-providers` (without trailing slash)
- Backend/nginx was issuing 307 redirects to `/api/v1/medical-providers/` (with trailing slash)
- During 307 redirects, the Authorization header was being lost, causing 401 unauthorized errors

**iOS App Fixes:**
- Updated medical provider API URLs to include trailing slashes: `/medical-providers/`, `/medications/`
- Exception: Search endpoints use no trailing slash to match backend routing: `/medical-providers/search`
- Prevents 307 redirects that lose authentication headers during POST requests

**Backend Verification:**
- Confirmed medical provider endpoints work correctly when called with proper URLs
- All CRUD operations functional when authentication headers are preserved
- Search functionality working with both legacy and new Google Places APIs

**Testing:**
- Backend logs now show direct 401 responses (expected with test tokens) instead of 307 redirects
- Medical provider creation should now work properly in iOS app with valid authentication

## [2025-08-02 19:55 EST] - Fix Medical Provider and Medication API Data Format Inconsistencies

Fixed critical issues in provider and medication endpoints that were preventing frontend-backend communication:

**Backend Medication Fixes:**
- Fixed syntax error in medications endpoint query (missing `medications.select()`)
- Updated MedicationCreate schema to not require family_id from frontend (set automatically from current_user)
- Fixed MedicationResponse to return string timestamps for iOS compatibility instead of datetime objects
- Ensured proper error handling and missing return statements in medication endpoints

**Backend Medical Provider Fixes:**
- Confirmed medical provider endpoints have complete CRUD operations and data consistency
- Medical provider endpoints already properly handle string timestamps and family_id assignment
- Google Places API search functionality working correctly with both legacy and new APIs

**Data Format Standardization:**
- Both endpoints now consistently return string format for created_at/updated_at fields
- Family_id is automatically set from authenticated user context, not required in request payload
- All CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) tested and working properly

**Deployment:**
- Backend successfully deployed and running at https://calndr.club
- Health endpoint confirms database and Redis connectivity
- API documentation available at https://calndr.club/docs
- All endpoints properly secured and returning expected authentication errors for unauthorized requests

## [2025-01-28 19:04 EST] - Enhance Medical Provider Functionality with Click-to-Call and Directions

Major enhancement to medical provider functionality with improved user experience and automation:

**Enhanced Search Results:**
- Redesigned search result cards with clear visual hierarchy and 'Add' button
- Added distance display for location-based searches (shows km from current location)
- Auto-save functionality - clicking a search result immediately saves the provider to database
- Clickable phone numbers that launch the phone app for instant calling
- Clickable addresses that open maps app for turn-by-turn directions

**Enhanced Saved Provider Cards:**
- Added click-to-call functionality for existing saved provider phone numbers
- Added click-for-directions for existing saved provider addresses
- Smart maps integration with fallback chain: Apple Maps → Google Maps → Web Maps

**Technical Improvements:**
- Phone number cleaning and validation for reliable dialing
- URL encoding for map address queries
- Cross-platform maps support with graceful fallbacks

- Theme-aware UI with accent colors for interactive elements

**Backend Implementation Guide:**
Created comprehensive prompt file (BACKEND_MEDICAL_PROVIDER_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md) with complete instructions for backend chatbot to implement medical provider API endpoints, database schema, and Pydantic models following existing patterns.

## [2025-01-28 18:48 EST] - Fix Medical Provider Search Field Mapping

Fixed remaining medical provider search JSON parsing error related to field name mapping. After fixing the response wrapper issue, discovered that backend returns camelCase field names (phoneNumber, placeId) while iOS model expected snake_case (phone_number, place_id). Updated CodingKeys mapping to match actual backend response format and added missing distance field. Medical provider search should now successfully parse all response fields and display search results correctly.

## [2025-01-28 18:35 EST] - Fix Medical Provider Search JSON Parsing Error

Fixed medical provider search functionality that was failing with "data couldn't be read because it isn't in the correct format" error. The issue was a mismatch between the backend response format and iOS expectations. Backend returns medical search results wrapped in an object with 'results' array and 'total' count, but iOS was expecting a direct array. Added MedicalSearchResponse wrapper model to match backend format and updated API decoding logic. Enhanced debugging logs helped identify the actual response structure. Medical provider search should now work correctly.

## [2025-01-28 18:32 EST] - Fix App Transport Security Error -1022 for API Calls

Fixed critical App Transport Security (ATS) error that was blocking API calls to the staging server. The error indicated that HTTP requests were being blocked due to ATS security policy requiring secure connections. Added NSAppTransportSecurity configuration to Info.plist to allow both HTTP and HTTPS connections specifically for staging.calndr.club domain. Also added enhanced logging to fetchReminders API method to help debug URL construction and ATS-related issues. This resolves the "resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security policy requires the use of a secure connection" error.

## [2025-01-28 17:57 EST] - Fix Custody Cache Invalidation After Updates

Fixed critical issue where custody changes appeared in the UI but reverted after refreshing the page. The problem was that successful custody updates were updating the local memory but not invalidating or updating the cached custody records. Now when custody is successfully changed via API, the cache is immediately updated with the new state to ensure changes persist across app refreshes and reloads. Added proper cache update logic to both toggleCustodian() and updateCustodyForSingleDay() methods.

## [2025-01-28 17:21 EST] - Fix Medical Provider Manual Entry Form Theme in Light Mode

Fixed theme styling issue where the medical provider manual entry form appeared with a dark background while in light mode. Applied proper theme styling to the Form component including scrollContentBackground(.hidden), theme-aware background and foreground colors, preferred color scheme, and section header styling. The form now consistently respects the current theme and provides the same user experience as other themed forms throughout the app.

## [2025-01-28 15:50 EST] - Add Comprehensive Medical Section to Settings

Added a comprehensive Medical section to the app settings with two main features: Doctors and Medications management. The Medical section includes location-based doctor search using MapKit, medication tracking with scheduling and reminders, and a tabbed interface for easy navigation. Created complete data models for MedicalProvider and Medication with full CRUD operations. Added location search functionality that allows users to find doctors by name, address, or zip code with automatic address filling. Implemented medication management with dosage tracking, frequency options, start/end dates, and reminder system integration. The system follows existing UI patterns and integrates with the current theme system.

## [2025-01-28 15:45 EST] - Implement Comprehensive Local Caching System

Implemented a comprehensive local caching system to improve app performance and reduce API calls. Added CacheManager.swift with intelligent caching for user profiles (24h expiry), custody records (2h expiry), and event records (2h expiry). Implemented cache-first approach that loads cached data immediately on app startup, then fetches fresh data in the background. Added automatic cache invalidation, bulk operations, and cache statistics. The system caches current month data for instant access and provides seamless offline experience while maintaining data freshness.

## [2025-01-28 15:30 EST] - Add Retry Logic for 504 Gateway Timeout Errors

Implemented comprehensive retry mechanism to handle 504 Gateway Timeout errors when fetching custody records. Added exponential backoff retry logic that attempts up to 3 times with increasing delays (2s, 4s, 6s) for both HTTP 504 errors and network timeouts. Set custom timeout intervals (30s request, 60s resource) to prevent long waits and improve user experience. Enhanced error logging to track retry attempts and provide better debugging information.

## [2025-01-28 15:15 EST] - Remove Security Section from Settings

Removed the security section from the app settings to simplify the user interface. Deleted SecuritySettingsView.swift and removed all security-related navigation from SettingsView. Users can still manage their account settings through the Account section, but security-specific options have been removed.

## [2025-01-28 14:45 EST] - Implement Custom Paging Behavior for All Scroll Views

Implemented comprehensive custom paging behavior across all scroll views in the iOS app. Added CustomScrollBehaviors.swift with both horizontal and vertical paging behaviors featuring 1/3 threshold ratio, direction detection, and boundary handling. Applied CustomHorizontalPagingBehavior to theme selectors and CustomVerticalPagingBehavior to all vertical scroll views including JournalView, SchedulesView, AccountsView, SettingsView, and others. This provides consistent, smooth paging behavior throughout the entire app.

## [2025-01-28 14:20 EST] - Fix Blue Flash During Month Transitions

Fixed the blue screen flash that appeared for a split second when scrolling between months in the iOS calendar. The issue was caused by extremely short animation durations (10ms) and TabView's default blue background showing through during transitions. Improved animation timing from 10ms to 150ms for smoother transitions and added explicit background color to prevent system blue from flashing.

## [2025-01-28 12:19 EST] - JSON Error Pattern Analysis & Enhanced Debugging

### 🔍 **JSON Format Issue: Deeper Analysis**

#### **Error Pattern Identified:**
- **Affected Months**: 2025-6, 2025-7, 2025-8 (June, July, August 2025)
- **Root Cause**: Backend returns `{"error": "message"}` with HTTP 200 instead of empty array `[]`
- **Expected Format**: `[CustodyResponse]` array or proper HTTP error status
- **Current Format**: `{"error": "some message"}` with successful HTTP status

#### **Enhanced Debugging Added:**
- **🏁🏁🏁**: Method execution tracking with year-month and URL verification
- **🚨**: HTTP error status detection (400+ codes) with response body logging
- **📄**: Enhanced error response parsing for `{"error": "message"}` format
- **Error Response Priority**: Check error format before attempting array decode

### 🎯 **Technical Root Cause**

#### **fetchCustodyRecordsForYear() Pattern:**
```swift
// Calls API for ALL 12 months of current year
for month in 1...12 {
    APIService.shared.fetchCustodyRecords(year: year, month: month)
}
```

#### **Backend Response Inconsistency:**
- **Months with data**: Returns `[{id: 1, event_date: "2025-01-01", ...}]` ✅
- **Months without data**: Returns `{"error": "No records found"}` ❌
- **Should return**: Empty array `[]` or HTTP 404

### 🛠️ **iOS Improvements Implemented**

#### **1. Error Response Detection**
```swift
// NEW: Detect error responses before array decode
let errorResponse = try JSONDecoder().decode([String: String].self, from: data)
if let errorMessage = errorResponse["error"] {
    // Handle as server error with proper status code
}
```

#### **2. HTTP Status Code Validation**
```swift
// NEW: Check for HTTP errors before JSON processing
if httpResponse.statusCode >= 400 {
    print("🚨 HTTP Error: \(httpResponse.statusCode)")
    // Handle HTTP errors properly
}
```

#### **3. Enhanced Debug Flow**
1. **🏁**: Method called with parameters
2. **📄📄📄**: Raw JSON response (when visible)
3. **🚨**: HTTP status analysis
4. **📄**: Error response vs array decode attempts

### 🎯 **Backend Fix Needed**

#### **Current Problematic Response:**
```json
HTTP 200 OK
{"error": "No custody records found for this month"}
```

#### **Recommended Fix:**
```json
HTTP 200 OK
[]  // Empty array for no data
```

**OR:**
```json
HTTP 404 Not Found
{"error": "No custody records found for this month"}
```

### 📊 **Next Steps**
1. **🏁🏁🏁**: Test and capture method execution logs
2. **📄📄📄**: Identify why raw JSON logs aren't showing  
3. **🚨**: Check HTTP status codes for problem months
4. **Backend**: Fix endpoint to return consistent array format

### 🔗 **Related Issues Status**
1. **JWT Token**: ✅ RESOLVED
2. **Server Timeouts**: ✅ IDENTIFIED & HANDLED  
3. **JSON Format**: 🔍 ROOT CAUSE FOUND, DEBUGGING ENHANCED

## [2025-01-28 09:05 EST] - Server Timeout Issue Resolution & Root Cause Analysis

### 🎉 **Major Progress: Multiple Issues Identified & Resolved**

#### ✅ **JWT Token Issue: RESOLVED**
- **Status**: ✅ Authentication working properly
- **Evidence**: No 401 errors in latest logs
- **Result**: API requests reaching server successfully

#### 🚨 **Root Cause Identified: AWS SNS Timeout**
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: Backend custody updates timing out after ~60 seconds
- **Bottleneck**: `send_custody_change_notification()` making external AWS SNS calls without timeout
- **Backend Operations**: Multiple synchronous operations causing delays:
  1. Database queries for user lookup
  2. AWS SNS push notification API calls (SLOW)
  3. Redis cache invalidation operations
  4. Complex handoff logic processing

### 🛠️ **Client-Side Improvements Implemented**

#### **1. Enhanced Timeout Handling**
- **Request Timeout**: Increased to 120 seconds for custody operations
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly 504 timeout explanations
- **Server Error Categorization**: Specific handling for 5xx errors

#### **2. Duplicate Request Prevention**  
- **In-Flight Tracking**: Prevent multiple rapid button taps
- **Enhanced Logging**: Track concurrent request patterns
- **UI Feedback**: Better handling of slow server responses

### 📊 **Backend Performance Bottlenecks Identified**

#### **Primary Issue: Push Notifications**
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE IN backend/services/notification_service.py
sns_client.publish(  # NO TIMEOUT HANDLING
    TargetArn=other_user['sns_endpoint_arn'],
    Message=json.dumps(message),
    MessageStructure='json'
)
```

#### **Secondary Issues:**
- **Database Queries**: Multiple sequential queries during custody update
- **Cache Operations**: Redis timeout reduced to 2 seconds (good)
- **Complex Logic**: Handoff calculations and validations

### 🎯 **Backend Optimization Recommendations**

#### **1. Async Notifications (High Priority)**
```python
# RECOMMENDED SOLUTION
import asyncio
import concurrent.futures

async def send_custody_change_notification_async(...):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future = executor.submit(sns_client.publish, ...)
        try:
            await asyncio.wait_for(
                asyncio.wrap_future(future), 
                timeout=5.0  # 5 second timeout
            )
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            logger.warning("Push notification timed out, continuing...")
```

#### **2. Background Task Processing**
- Move push notifications to background queue (Celery/RQ)
- Return custody update response immediately
- Process notifications asynchronously

#### **3. Database Optimization**
- Combine user queries into single JOIN operation
- Add database indexes for custody lookups
- Consider read replicas for heavy query operations

### 📈 **Performance Results**
- **Request Timeout**: Extended from 60s to 120s
- **Error Handling**: Clear timeout messages for users
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Reduced unnecessary server load
- **Root Cause**: AWS SNS external dependency identified

### 🔗 **Related Issues Status**
1. **JWT Token Corruption**: ✅ RESOLVED
2. **JSON Format Mismatch**: 🔍 Still investigating (separate issue)
3. **Server Timeouts**: ✅ IDENTIFIED & CLIENT-SIDE HANDLED

## [2025-01-28 00:23 EST] - Custody Records JSON Format Mismatch Investigation

### 🚨 **Secondary Issue Identified: JSON Decoding Failure**
- **Error**: "Expected to decode Array<Any> but found a dictionary instead"
- **Affected**: Custody records fetching for months 2025-6, 2025-7, 2025-8
- **Root Cause**: iOS app expects array `[CustodyResponse]` but backend returns dictionary
- **Status**: Debugging enhanced with comprehensive logging

### 🔍 **JSON Response Debugging Added**
- **📄 Raw JSON Logging**: Enable complete API response logging for custody endpoints
- **🔄 Multi-Strategy Decoding**: Fallback decoding attempts for different response formats:
  1. Try as expected array `[CustodyResponse]`
  2. Fallback to single `CustodyResponse` wrapped in array
  3. Fallback to dictionary wrapper with `data`/`custody_records`/`records` field
- **📊 Enhanced Error Context**: Show URL, status code, and full response content

### 🎯 **Backend Analysis**
- **Expected Endpoint**: `GET /custody/{year}/{month}` → `List[CustodyResponse]` (array)
- **API Definition**: `@router.get("/{year}/{month}", response_model=List[CustodyResponse])`
- **Hypothesis**: Error responses or middleware may be wrapping array in dictionary

### 📝 **Investigation Strategy**
1. **📄📄📄** - Look for raw JSON response logs
2. **📄 Status Code** - Check HTTP response status (200 vs error codes)
3. **📄 Response** - Examine actual JSON structure returned
4. **✅/❌** - Track decode success/failure patterns

- **Event fetching optimization**: Reduced API calls from 3 to 1 for better performance
- **Data consistency**: Ensured single source of truth for all event types

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Database verification**: Only 1 daycare event existed for July 4th ("Fourth of July")
- **iOS duplication**: App was fetching daycare events twice:
  - Via `/events/` API (returns ALL events via `family_all_events` view)
  - Via `/events/daycare/` API (returns daycare-only events)
- **Combination issue**: `familyEvents + schoolEvents + daycareEvents` caused duplicates

### iOS CalendarViewModel Improvements
- **Simplified API logic**: Removed separate `fetchSchoolEvents()` and `fetchDaycareEvents()` calls
- **Single endpoint**: Main `/events/` API already returns ALL event types (family, school, daycare)
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained legacy `schoolEvents` array for existing UI components
